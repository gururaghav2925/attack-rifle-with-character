# Ex-04-Attach Rifle with character mesh and implementation bullet spawn from Rifle 


## Aim
To attach a rifle to a character's skeletal mesh and implement the functionality for bullets to spawn from the rifle's muzzle when fired.

## Procedure

1. *Setup the Rifle Mesh:*
   - Import the rifle mesh into the game engine (e.g., Unreal Engine).
   - Create a socket on the character's skeleton (typically on the "hand_r" or similar bone) using the Skeleton Editor.
   - Name the socket appropriately (e.g., RifleSocket).

2. *Attach Rifle to Character:*
   - In the character blueprint or code, attach the rifle to the socket using:
     cpp
     RifleMesh->AttachToComponent(GetMesh(), FAttachmentTransformRules::SnapToTargetIncludingScale, "RifleSocket");
     

3. *Define Muzzle Location:*
   - Add a scene component (e.g., MuzzleLocation) as a child of the rifle mesh at the desired position of the muzzle.
   - This will serve as the bullet spawn point.

4. *Implement Bullet Spawning:*
   - Create a bullet actor class with a projectile component.
   - In the characterâ€™s shooting function, spawn the bullet at MuzzleLocation with appropriate rotation:
     cpp
     FVector MuzzlePos = MuzzleLocation->GetComponentLocation();
     FRotator MuzzleRot = MuzzleLocation->GetComponentRotation();
     GetWorld()->SpawnActor<ABullet>(BulletClass, MuzzlePos, MuzzleRot);
     

5. *Add Input Binding (Optional):*
   - Bind a key or mouse input to trigger the firing function in the character class.

## Result

- The rifle was successfully attached to the character mesh using a custom socket.
- Bullets spawned correctly from the muzzle of the rifle when the firing input was triggered.
- The implementation resulted in a functional shooting mechanism where bullets originated from the correct position and direction.
